# firebase-patterns

A monorepo of small but powerful Firebase integration demos — built to explore and master Firebase across multiple stacks.

## Vision

This repo is my personal Firebase lab.

I'm building a library of minimal, real-world examples to:
- Understand Firebase deeply — across languages, frameworks, and use cases
- Test secure patterns for production dashboards, mobile apps, and APIs

## What You'll Find

Each folder in this monorepo is a self-contained project showing how to use Firebase in a specific stack or pattern:


## Tech Stack

- Firebase Emulator Suite
- Firestore, Auth, Storage
- TypeScript, Node.js, Flutter, Spring Boot, Python, Laravel (planned)
- Focus on local-first development and secure integration patterns

## About

Maintained by [Mxolisi Masuku](https://github.com/mxomasuku) — an independent full-stack developer on a mission to master Firebase and build systems that stand the test of scale, safety, and speed.

Most people use Firebase. I’m here to understand it — so I can drop it into any stack and make it work efficiently
